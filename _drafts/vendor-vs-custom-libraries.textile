While vendor libraries have APIs that are often outside our control

It would be nice if While it would ideal to use as many vendor libraries as possible to avoid having to write and design everything, contract work often requires a good deal of customization.  A library that meets 80% of your criteria can be 100% useless.  

Other times a library that is featureful and robust enough to meet your project's needs, may have steep learning curves or little useful documentation.  For this reason it is sometimes easier to write your own small library.  I can't tell you how many times I've found that writing a custom class/library/control was the easier alternative.  Nowadays, documentation is often lacking and hackers are content to direct you to "read the code".  Documentation is almost always an afterthought if thought of at all.  (It's more fun writing code!)
