			We often hear the term "full-stack developer" used to describe someone who can do everything from server set up to wrangling CSS. If you're striking out on your own, you need to become a Full-Stack Employee. At the very least, you'll need to partner with someone such that the two of you combined form a Full-Stack Employee. A Full-Stack Employee is a full-stack developer that can also do marketing, usability testing, adwords and facebook ads, SEO, make sense of analytics and just has a good general sense of what the product should and shouldn't do. Scott and I together make a Full-Stack Employee, you should find your complement.
