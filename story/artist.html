<p>
If I  was hit by a truck, and I was lying out in that gutter dieing, and I had time to program one Video Game
One Video Game that people would remember before I was dirt.  
One Video Game that would let God know what I felt about my time on earth.
One Video Game that would sum me up.
What Video Game would I program
What Video Game would I program that is real and that I felt
That's the kinda Video Game people want to play.
Thats the Video Game the truly saves peopled.

The Paradolia System is an art project created by globHammer starting in 2013 and ending in 2022. 
The exhibition consists of interconnected video games on large format touchscreens shown together with related paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, and costumes.
The Paradolia System is constructed in such a way that the game continually plays itself indepenately through out the creation of the exhibition.
Perodically the piece is upated with new code and graphics adjusting the outcomes of its internal physics resulting in the creation of larger possiblity spaces
When the Paradolia Sytem boots on April 14, 2014 at 4:44 am, transmitted live gameplay footage will be accessible in realtime 24 hours a day.
All artwork produced at the end of each year will collected and showcased within various art galleries worldwide.
Intially Paradolia 13 will be shown at Craiggle McTaggles Gallery in Bushwick, Brooklyn during the fall of 2014.
The Paradolia System culminates in a major museum exhibition followed by a traveling retrospective occuring through out 2023.

The game centers it self around two different sections.

become part of the framework by taking on the role of either Controllers or Observers.  


layers collectively unravel the secerts of an alternate universe by focusing time on many differnt forms.
The Paradolia System is at its core an infinite aesthetic game. 
An artichtecturial framework is present yet refrains from resolving into any overall rational structure except for a few key aspects. 
The audinence becomes part of the framework by taking on the role of either Controllers or Observers.  
Controllers own the ability to indirectly influnce the environment of a single naked independant creature playing a game.
Controllers can become Observers at any point by refusing to exert control past a certain threshold of time.
The game reveales itself to Observers and Controllers through a series of reactions to the thoughts of the creature. 
The amount of Observers or Controllers present inside the Paradolia framework sometimes influnces the reactions of the game.
Each individual game is known by its Title.
Titles are individually labeled in such a way to present additional context as to the nature of the game.
Titles are visually created from artistic techniques such as sculpture, photography, drawing, or painting.
Conceptual starting points for Titles come from a variety of sources including mythology, religous dogma, high art, or contemporary cluture.
Titles are built out of a random series of Beats.
Beats contain rules for both entry inside and exit outward.
Beats are sometimes randomly populated with Exercises.
The creature gains agency over a Title as it responds to these Exercises. 
Some Exercises can be used to strengthing the connection of the creature to the Title by allowing longer play.
Other Exercises are capable of removing the creature from playing the Title all together.
All Exercises, Beats, or Titles are incapable of removing the creature from the Paradolia System.
If the creature is removed from the play of any Title, it undergoes a Restart.
In a Restart the creature is transported to a new point in time within a Beat inside a different Title.
During the Restart, Referees of the Title fashion the creature a new form made out of green Amniotic fluid and different Noble Metals.
Ocassionally knowledge gained in one Title transfers over to the next Title.
Inside each Title exists a mystery known as the Law.
Upon mastery of a Law ownership of the Title can be Won.
Winning a Title triggers an event known as the Spectacle, followed immeditatly by a Restart. 
Ocassionally the creature is stripped of all knowledge gained from the Winning the Title.
The nature of the Paradolia Framework refrains from resolving into any rational structure. 
it is subject to adjustment by globHammer at any point in the future.

globHammer is the corpertate enity that uses primarliy painting and programming to play with the expressive boundaries of Art.
We forge special types of creative weapons which behave like a toys. 
globHammer is the result of merging artists together from different media and different worlds.
In the beginning, their was only two.
One spang from the dew dropped golf courses of North Carolina.
The other crawled out of the gator infested swamps of South Georgia. 
First they became dorm mates during freshman year at the Savannah College of Art and Design. 
After graduation they seasoned themselves separtely in both the New York City Fine Art Scene and Silcon Valley Startup Culture.
Their artisty solidified as a whole in 2011 by forming globHammer. 
They began showcasing their collaborations in gallery settings starting with Factory Fresh in Bushwick, Brooklyn.
From the very beginning, thier worked induced confusion.
Last summer, a globHammer piece hung on the walls of one of the oldest galleries in the United States, James Graham & Sons on the Upper East Side.
