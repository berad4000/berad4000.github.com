<h2>Conflict Engine</h2>

<p>
In the battle system every wound is unique.
In the battle system all wounds could heal.
The simulation would calculate a time in the future when the wound would be healed.
Once the simulation passed that about of time the wound would be removed.
Despite every wound being unique all wounds fell into four diffent types.
The first type of wound came in form of Tears.
The second type wound came in the form of Bruises.
It took alot of Tears to turn into a Bruise.
Bruises could turn into Cuts.
Cuts were dangerous because they could turn in Clips.
Too many Clips and you where gone.
Also, you could always bleed to death if you took too many Cuts.
If Died you would always be reborn. 
However, you would never be reborn in the place same place you died.
While you had adventures in SRC you would grow.
It took failures to make you change.
Every time you failed you got a chance to improve.
The number of wounds you could take depended on your size in the game.
The large the number of pixels it took to draw your character the higer the number of wounds you could take.
The player to modify the amount of wounds thier character could take called Grit.
The battle system also included machinics for stunning the player should they ever take too many cuts or bruises.
This was the battle system and that had been built.
