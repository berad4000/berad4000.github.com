<h2>Form Forge</h2>

<p>
Controllers have the power to create life. 
They do this through use of the Form Forge. 
The Forge is made of many icons which represent different Forms in the Glob Rock cosmos. 
The Forms are the blueprints for perfection. 
Touching the Form will embedded it with the Controller's Focus which is measured in time. 
Embedding the Form with greater amount of Focus will activate more Forms. 
When the Controller is ready to breathe life into the cosmos, the Summon Queen Button is clicked.
Afterward a Queen Sky Sex Bee spills her Divine Jelly into the Cosmos.
A new life form is created.
Over the time the life form ages.
When a life form's lifespan runs out the creature dies and is removed from the simulation.
The focus spent on the creature returns to the Controller.
Depending on the creature sometimes that aount is more, the same, or even less.
Ocassionally the Queen will choose one of the Controllers existing creations and make it grander. 
The type of life form created depends on several factors the most important of which includes the stage of the Sky Sex Bee hive development on the plant. 
Life forms that are created are placed into three different varities, common, uncommon, and rare. 
Advancement of the hive unlocks the rarest forms of life. 
The advancement of the hive depends on the quality and diversity of the life found on the planet.
