<p>
"Cue the sun!"
Since nit everyone has access to the type of computer we use, we have taken measures to make sure our games can be witnessed by the widest audience possible.
Titles are constructed in such a way to enable the game to continually play itself absent of human control.
These autonomous experiences are broadcast  constantly the internet 24 hours a day.
In the beginning due to budget constrains the game will be controlled by an artificial intelligence.
Members of the globHammer team will take over at random times.
Feedback will be present to the audience so they will understand which type of control is underway, human or computer.
In future years all our broadcast games will played entirely by members of globHammer.

"By the Power of Greyskull... I Have the Power!"
Our video games are built out the fabric of the Internet itself.
globHammer games are built entirely out of javascript code and the HTML 5 Canvas tag.
We do this to give our games an archival quality.
The first websites ever built can still viewed  within any modern web browser.
We expect the works of globHammer to be enjoyed as long as the Internet exists.
Like the ancient  Greek statues, it is our desire that the multitude of future generations be granted the opportunity to play our games and walk away inspired.
