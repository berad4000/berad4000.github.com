<h2>Hi.</h2>

<p>
I'm Elliot Bradly. Welcome to the Sky Sex Bee Simulation.
For as long I as I remember I have been entranced with the idea of creating a game that plays itself. 
Sky Sex Bee is the culmination of my exploration. 
I believe there are groups of people like myself who incredibly engaged by watching simulations unfold without out direct control over the final outcome. 
If that sounds like an idea your are interested in please stick around. 
I want to share with you what I have imagined.
</p>

<h2>What is Sky Sex Bee</h2>
<p>
Sky Sex Bee is a website where people create life collectively inside an persistent universe simulation. 
The website is split into two separate type of experiences for two types of players, Controllers and Observers. 
Like watching an aquarium, Observers can only watch the universe grow and take shape. 
At any point of the day, you can use your phone, tablet, laptop of desktop as a window into the world. 
By using your mouse or finger you can explore this synthetic cosmos and discover the beauty of new life forms as they are created, live, and die.
